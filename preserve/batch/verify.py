#         NAME: verify
#  DESCRIPTION: Verify two sets of files (on disk or as recorded in CSV file)
#               by comparing number of files, relative paths, and a file
#               signature consisting of checksum + byte length. Attempt to
#               reason about the nature of the differences and print a report
#               about them to the console.
